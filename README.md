# Q-Learning

QLearning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm which aims to find the best action for the current state to reach the Goal by interacting continuously with the 
environment. The agent comes across various situations in the environment which are referred to as states. The agent in a state needs to choose from a set of allowable actions
which may give the agent 1 reward when it arrives at the terminal states, or otherwise receive -0.1 reward. The agent learns to maximize these rewards in order to find the most 
optimum path and least time required to reach the Goal.
